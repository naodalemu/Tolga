            <p class="title-description">Make calculations, and define and modify variables.</p>

            <p class="basic-text">Welcome to the Intro to Programming course! This course is for you if you have never
                written a single line of code, and you are interested in learning data science and machine learning. (If
                you do have programming experience and are just new to the Python language, the Python course is a
                better fit to get started.)</p>

            <p class="basic-text">In this course, you will learn how to use code to get a computer to perform certain
                tasks for you. Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data science, and it's the
                language you'll learn in this course. Once you complete this course, you'll be fully prepared to
                progress to the Python course, followed by the Intro to Machine Learning course.</p>

            <p class="basic-text">In this tutorial, you'll see several examples of Python code. You'll get a chance to
                write your own code in the exercise. (If you'd like to preview the exercise, feel free to take a look
                now. We also provide a link to the exercise at the end of this tutorial.)</p>

            <h2 class="sub-header">Printing</h2>
            <p class="basic-text">One of the simplest (and most important!) tasks you can ask a computer to do is to
                print a message.</p>

            <p class="basic-text">In Python, we ask a computer to print a message for us by writing <span
                    class="inline-code">print()</span> and putting
                the message inside the parentheses and enclosed in quotation marks. Below, we ask the computer to print
                the message <span class="inline-code">Hello, world!</span>.</p>

            <div class="code-snippet-container">
                <div class="code-snippet">
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-python">
print("Hello, world!")
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <div class="try-it">Try it yourself &RightAngleBracket;&RightAngleBracket;</div>
                </div>

                <p class="output-indicator">Output:</p>

                <div class="code-result">
                    <pre>
                        <code class="output language-python">
Hello, world!
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="basic-text">The code is inside the box (known as a <b>code cell</b>), and the computer's response
                (called
                the <b>output</b> of the code) is shown below the text Output. As you can see, the computer printed the
                message that we
                wanted.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-header">Arithmetic</h2>
            <p class="basic-text">We can also print the value of some arithmetic operation (such as addition,
                subtraction, multiplication, or division).</p>

            <p class="basic-text">For instance, in the next code cell, the computer adds 2 to 1 and then prints the
                result, which is 3. Note that unlike when we were simply printing text, we don't use any quotation
                marks.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="basic-text">We can also do subtraction in python. The next code cell subtracts 5 from 9 and prints
                the result, which is 4.</p>

                <div class="code-result">

                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="basic-text">In general, Python follows the <a
                    href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html">PEMDAS rule</a> when deciding the
                order of operations.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-header">Comments</h2>
            <p class="basic-text">We use <b>comments</b> to annotate what code is doing. They help other people to
                understand
                your code, and they can also be helpful if you haven't looked at your own code in a while. So far, the
                code that we have written is very short, but annotations become more important when you have written a
                lot of code.</p>

            <p class="basic-text">For instance, in the next code cell, we multiply 3 by 2. We also add a comment (<span
                    class="inline-code">#Multiply 3 by 2</span>) above the code to describe what the code is doing.</p>

            <div class="code-snippet-container">
                <div class="code-snippet">
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-python">
# Multiply 3 by 2
print(3 * 2)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <div class="try-it">Try it yourself &RightAngleBracket;&RightAngleBracket;</div>
                </div>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="basic-text">To indicate to Python that a line is comment (and not Python code), you need to write
                a pound sign (<span class="inline-code">#</span>) as the very first character.</p>
            <p class="basic-text">Once Python sees the pound sign and recognizes that the line is a comment, it is
                completely ignored by the computer. This is important, because just like English or Hindi (or any other
                language!), Python is a language with very strict rules that need to be followed. Python is stricter
                than a human listener, though, and will just error if it can't understand the code.</p>
            <p class="basic-text">We can see an example of this, in the code cell below. Python errors if we remove the
                pound sign, because the text in the comment is not valid Python code, so it can't be interpreted
                properly.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-header">Variables</h2>
            <p class="basic-text">So far, you have used code to make a calculation and print the result, and the result
                isn't saved anywhere. However, you can imagine that you might want to save the result to work with it
                later. For this, you'll need to use <b>variables</b>.</p>

            <p class="basic-text">The next code cell creates a variable named <span class="inline-code">test_var</span>

            <p class="basic-text">In general, to work with a variable, you need to begin by selecting the name you want
                to use. Variable names are ideally short and descriptive. They also need to satisfy several
                requirements:</p>

            <ul class="lists">
                <li class="list-content basic-text">They can't have spaces (e.g., test var is not allowed)</li>
                <li class="list-content basic-text">They can only include letters, numbers, and underscores (e.g.,
                    <span class="inline-code">test_var!</span> is not allowed)
                </li>
                <li class="list-content basic-text">They have to start with a letter or underscore (e.g., <span
                        class="inline-code">1_var</span> is not allowed)</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="basic-text">Then, to create the variable, you need to use <span class="inline-code">=</span> to
                assign the value that you want it
                to have.</p>
            <p class="basic-text">You can always take a look at the value assigned to the variable by using <span
                    class="inline-code">print()</span> and
                putting the name of the variable in parentheses.</p>
            <p class="basic-text">Over time, you'll learn how to select good names for Python variables. It's completely
                fine for it to feel uncomfortable now, and the best way to learn is just by viewing a lot of Python
                code!</p>

            <h2 class="small-sub-header sub-header">Manipulating variables</h2>
            <p class="basic-text">You can always change the value assigned to a variable by overriding the previous
                value.</p>
            <p class="basic-text">In the code cell below, we change the value of <span class="inline-code">my_var</span>

            <p class="basic-text">It's common for code to use multiple variables. This is especially useful when we have
                to do a long calculation with multiple inputs.</p>

            <p class="basic-text">In the next code cell, we calculate the number of seconds in four years. This
                calculation uses five inputs.</p>

            <div class="code-snippet-container adjust-stuff">
                <div class="code-snippet">
                    <pre>

                    </pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="basic-text">As calculated above, there are 126144000 seconds in four years.</p>
            <p class="basic-text">Note it is possible to do this calculation without variables as just <span
                    class="inline-code">60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 4</span>, but it is much harder to check that the
                calculation without variables does not have some error,
                because it is not as readable. When we use variables (such as <span
                    class="inline-code">num_years</span>, <span class="inline-code">days_per_year</span>, etc), we
                canbetter keep track of each part of the calculation and more easily check for and correct any mistakes.
            </p>

            <p class="basic-text">Note that it is particularly useful to use variables when the values of the inputs can
                change. For instance, say we want to slightly improve our estimate by updating the value of the number
                of days in a year from 365 to 365.25, to account for leap years. Then we can change the value assigned
                to <span class="inline-code">days_per_year</span> without changing any of the other variables and redo
                the calculation.</p>

            <p class="basic-text"><b>Note</b>: You might have noticed the .0 added at the end of the number, which might look
                unnecessary. This is caused by the fact that in the second calculation, we used a number with a
                fractional part (365.25), whereas the first calculation multipled just numbers with no fractional part.
                You'll learn more about this in Lesson 3, when we cover data types.</p>
